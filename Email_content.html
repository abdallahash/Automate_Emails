    <p>Hello <strong>{}</strong></p>
    <p><strong><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=upwork&amp;rlz=1C1CHZL_enMY740MY740&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3narWwqfjAhUKRY8KHQdTBd0Q_AUIECgB&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=720#imgrc=IYRqJdixljsEKM:" alt="upwork " width="645" height="285" /></strong></p>
    <p>I had an Upwork profile for about 3 months and just 3 days ago I was able to get my first client on Upwork using this strategy that I want to share with you right now.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Just want to share how I went throw it so you could add this as a strategy for you.</p>
    <p>So I found this job posting on Upwork the guy want's someone to help him run a python script and learn how does it work he said that there is no any tutorial online to show him how to run it.</p>
    <p>I had a look at the scripts and honestly, I didn't understand it either at first, so I tried to learn it for myself.</p>
    <p>spend an entire weekend trying to figure it out. And eventually, I got it was pretty simple then.</p>
    <p>What I did was, I made a 3 minutes video introducing myself and I explained to him briefly how it works and action steps that he could do to actually run the script.</p>
    <p>This was his replay a few days later: "I would love to work with you on this Abdallah. I appreciate you sending over the demonstration that was great! Looking forward to doing frequent business in the future. Where should we start?"</p>
    <p>So I scheduled a zoom meeting and send him the link, before the call I had some fear but, when I really started I noticed that he did not know anything about python so along the way I was explaining how to save the file how to use command line and all of this good stuff for 1:30hr.</p>
    <p>At the end he still had some questions and other problem because it's a project that he is working on, so he ends up asking me if I can figure it out and schedule another call later this week.</p>
    <p>Basically, that's it guys go ahead and try this see how it works, I used <a href="https://loom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loom</a> to make that initial video and send him a link to it. so check it out.</p>
    <p>Reply to this email and let me know what do you think about this and what other ways we could approach clients on Upwork, I would really appreciate that.</p>
